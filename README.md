GET and POST routes retrieve and add new data to the page from the linked database.

Items can be clicked on to view larger with a lightbox feature, and added to a shopping cart with the purchase button.
Only one item of each product is available, so after clicking purchase the button is no longer active.
The shopping cart may be emptied by clicking clear shopping bag.

The checkout button links to a new page, embedded with Stripe, a software platform for online shopping to handle payments.
