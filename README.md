This is a store for artisan, custom art frames and paintings for sale. 
It uses a Node and Express Web Server and is backed by a MySQL Sequelize database.
GET and POST routes retrieve and add new data to the page, and the tables within the linked database.
Items can be clicked on to view larger with a lightbox feature, and added to a shopping cart with the purchase button.
The checkout button links to a new page, embedded with Stripe, a software platform for online shopping to handle payments.
